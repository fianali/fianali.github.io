        Bubble tea (also known as pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, tapioca milk tea, boba tea, or boba; Chinese: 珍珠奶茶;
        pinyin:
        zhēnzhū nǎichá, 波霸奶茶; bōbà nǎichá; 泡泡茶; pàopào chá) is a tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early
        1980s.[1][2] It most commonly consists of tea accompanied by chewy tapioca balls ("boba" or "pearls"), but it
        can be
        made with other toppings as well, such as grass jelly, aloe vera, or red bean.

        Bubble tea has many varieties and flavors, but the two most popular varieties are black pearl milk tea and green
        pearl
        milk tea ("pearl" signifies the tapioca balls at the bottom).[3]

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Bubble teas fall under two categories: teas without milk and milk teas. Both varieties come with a choice of
            black,
            green, or oolong tea as the base.[1] Milk teas usually include powdered milk or fresh milk, but may also use
            condensed
            milk, almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk.[4]

            The oldest known bubble tea drink consisted of a mixture of hot Taiwanese black tea, tapioca pearls
            (Chinese:
            粉圓;
            pinyin: fěn yuán; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: hún-îⁿ), condensed milk, and syrup (Chinese: 糖漿; pinyin: táng jiāng) or
            honey.[5]
            Nowadays, bubble tea is most commonly served cold.[5] The tapioca pearls that make bubble tea so unique were
            originally
            made from the starch of the cassava, a tropical shrub known for its starchy roots[6] which was introduced to
            Taiwan from
            South America during Japanese colonial rule.[7] Larger pearls (Chinese: 波霸/黑珍珠; pinyin: bō bà/hēi zhēn zhū)
            quickly
            replaced these.[8]

            Today, there are some cafés that specialize in bubble tea production.[9] Some cafés use plastic lids, but
            more
            authentic
            bubble tea shops serve drinks using a machine to seal the top of the cup with heated plastic cellophane.[3]
            The
            latter
            method allows the tea to be shaken in the serving cup and makes it spill-free until a person is ready to
            drink
            it.[10]
            The cellophane is then pierced with an oversize straw, now referred to as a boba straw, which is larger than
            a
            typical
            drinking straw to allow the toppings to pass through.[11]

            Due to its popularity, bubble tea has inspired a variety of bubble tea flavored snacks such as bubble tea
            ice
            cream and
            bubble tea candy.[12] The high increase of bubble tea demand and its related industry can provide
            opportunities
            for
            possible market expansion.[13] The market size of bubble tea was valued at $2.4 billion in 2019 and is
            projected
            to
            reach $4.3 billion by the end of 2027.[13] Some of the largest global bubble tea chains include Chatime,
            CoCo
            Fresh Tea
            & Juice and Gong Cha.

        <h3>Drink</h3>
        <p>
            Bubble tea comes in many variations which usually consist of black tea, green tea, oolong tea, and sometimes
            white
            tea.[2] Another variation, yuenyeung, (Chinese: 鴛鴦, named after the Mandarin duck) originated in Hong Kong
            and consists
            of black tea, coffee, and milk.[1]

            Other varieties of the drink include blended tea drinks. These variations are often either blended using ice
            cream, or
            are smoothies that contain both tea and fruit.[10]
        </p>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <img src="images/Tapioca,_aka_boba.jpg" alt="tapioca pearls">
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca">Tapioca</a> (boba) are the most common ingredient,
            although there are other ways to make the chewy
            spheres found in
            bubble tea.[1] The pearls vary in color according to the ingredients mixed in with the tapioca. Most pearls
            are black
            from brown sugar.[2][14]

            Jelly comes in different shapes: small cubes, stars, or rectangular strips, and flavors such as coconut
            jelly, konjac,
            lychee, grass jelly, mango, coffee and green tea. Azuki bean or mung bean paste, typical toppings for
            Taiwanese shaved
            ice desserts, give bubble tea an added subtle flavor as well as texture. Aloe, egg pudding (custard), grass
            jelly, and
            sago also can be found in many bubble tea shops.[10][15] Popping boba, or spheres that have fruit juices or
            syrups
            inside them, are other popular bubble tea toppings.[16] Flavors include mango, strawberry, coconut, kiwi and
            honey
            melon.[16][17]

            Some shops offer milk or cheese foam on top of the drink, giving the drink a consistency similar to that of
            whipped
            cream, and a saltier flavor profile.[18] One shop described the effect of the cheese foam as "neutraliz[ing]
            the
            bitterness of the tea...and as you drink it you taste the returning sweetness of the tea".[19]
        </p>

        <h3>Preparation Method</h3>
        <p>
            The traditional way of bubble tea preparation is to mix the ingredients (sugar, powders and other
            flavorants) together
            using a bubble tea shaker cup, by hand.

            Many present-day bubble tea shops use a bubble tea shaker machine. This eliminates the need for humans to
            shake the
            bubble tea by hand. It also reduces staffing needs as multiple cups of bubble tea may be prepared by a
            single
            barista.[25]

            One bubble tea shop in Taiwan, named Jhu Dong Auto Tea, makes bubble tea entirely without manual work. All
            stages of the
            bubble tea sales process, from ordering, to making, to collection, are fully automated.[26]

    <section id="History">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Milk and sugar have been added to tea in Taiwan since the Dutch colonization of Taiwan in 1624–1662.[1]

            There are two competing stories for the discovery of bubble tea.[8] One is associated with the Chun Shui
            Tang tea room
            (Chinese: 春水堂人文茶館) in Taichung.[1] Its founder, Liu Han-Chieh, began serving Chinese tea cold after she
            observed coffee
            was served cold in Japan while on a visit in the 1980s.[1] The new style of serving tea propelled his
            business, and
            multiple chains serving this tea were established.[8] The company's product development manager, Lin Hsiu
            Hui, said she
            created the first bubble tea in 1988 when she poured tapioca balls into her tea during a staff meeting and
            encouraged
            others to drink it.[8] The beverage was well received by everyone at the meeting, leading to its inclusion
            on the menu.
            It ultimately became the franchise's top-selling product.[8]

            Another claim for the invention of bubble tea comes from the Hanlin Tea Room (Chinese: 翰林茶館) in Tainan. It
            claims that
            bubble tea was invented in 1986 when teahouse owner Tu Tsong-he was inspired by white tapioca balls he saw
            in the local
            market of Ah-bó-liâu (鴨母寮, or Yamuliao in Mandarin).[8] He later made tea using these traditional Taiwanese
            snacks.[8]
            This resulted in what is known as "pearl tea".[27]

    <section id="Popularity">
        <h2>Popularity</h2>
        <p>
            In the 1990s, bubble tea spread all over East and Southeast Asia with its ever-growing popularity. In
            regions like Hong
            Kong, Mainland China, Japan, Vietnam,[28] and Singapore, the bubble tea trend expanded rapidly among young
            people. In
            some popular shops, people would line up for more than thirty minutes to get a cup of the drink.[2] In
            recent years, the
            mania for bubble tea has gone beyond the beverage itself, with boba lovers inventing various bubble tea food
            such as
            bubble tea ice cream, bubble tea pizza, bubble tea toast, bubble tea sushi, bubble tea ramen, etc.[12]
        </p>

        <h3>Taiwan</h3>
        <p>
            In Taiwan, bubble tea has become more than a beverage, but an enduring icon of the culture and food history
            for the
            nation.[8][29] In 2020, the date April 30 was officially declared as National Bubble Tea Day in Taiwan.[2]
            That same
            year, the image of bubble tea was proposed as an alternative cover design for Taiwan's passport.[30]
            According to Al
            Jazeera, bubble tea has become synonymous with Taiwan and is an important symbol of Taiwanese identity both
            domestically
            and internationally.[31] Bubble tea is used to represent Taiwan in the context of the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_Tea_Alliance">Milk Tea Alliance</a>.[32][31]
        </p>

        <h3>China</h3>
        <p>
            Since the idea of adding tapioca pearls into milk tea was introduced into China in the 1990s, bubble tea has
            increased
            its popularity.[33] It is estimated that the consumption of bubble tea is 5 times that of coffee in the
            recent
            years.[33] According to data from QianZhen Industry Research Institute, the value of the tea-related
            beverage market in
            China has reached 53.7 billion yuan (about $7.63 billion) in 2018.[34] While bubble tea chains from Taiwan
            (e.g., Gong
            Cha and Coco) are still popular, more local brands, like Yi Dian Dian, Nayuki, Hey Tea, etc., are now
            dominating the
            market.[34]

            In China, young people's growing obsession with bubble tea shaped their way of social interaction. Buying
            someone a cup
            of bubble tea has become a new way of thanking someone informally. It is also a favored topic among friends
            and on
            social media.[34]
        </p>

        <h3>United States</h3>
        <img src="images/68812600_2408643319216482_2213390960539205632_n.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="share tea">
        <p>
            In the 1990s, Taiwanese immigrants opened the first bubble tea shop, Fantasia Coffee & Tea, in Cupertino,
            California.[41] Since then, chains like Tapioca Express, Quickly, Lollicup and Q-Cup emerged in the late
            1990s and early
            2000s, bringing the Taiwanese bubble tea trend to the US.[41] Within the Asian American community, bubble
            tea is
            commonly known under its colloquial term "boba".[5]

            As the beverage gained popularity in the US, it gradually became more than a drink, but a cultural identity
            for Asian
            Americans. This phenomenon was referred to as “boba life” by Chinese-American brothers Andrew and David Fung
            in their
            music video, “Bobalife,” released in 2013.[5] Boba symbolizes a subculture that Asian Americans as social
            minorities
            could define themselves as, and “boba life” is reflection of their desire for both cultural and political
            recognition.[42]

            Other regions with large concentrations of bubble tea restaurants in the United States are the Northeast and
            Southwest.
            This is reflected in the coffeehouse-style teahouse chains that originate from the regions, such as Boba Tea
            Company
            from Albuquerque, New Mexico, No. 1 Boba Tea in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Kung Fu Tea from New York
            City.[43][44][45]
            Albuquerque and Las Vegas have a large concentrations of boba tea restaurants, as the drink is popular
            especially among
            the Hispano, Navajo, Pueblo, and other Native American, Hispanic and Latino American communities in the
            Southwest.[46][47][48][49]

            A massive shipping and supply chain crisis on the U.S. West coast, coupled with the obstruction of the Suez
            Canal in
            March 2021, caused a shortage of tapioca pearls for bubble tea shops in the U.S. and Canada.[50][51] Most of
            the tapioca
            consumed in the U.S. is imported from Asia, since the critical ingredient, tapioca starch, is mostly grown
            in Asia.[52]

    <section id="PotentialHealthConcerns">
        <h2>Potential Health Concerns</h2>
        <p>
            In July 2019, Singapore's Mount Alvernia Hospital warned against the high sugar content of bubble tea since
            the drink
            had become extremely popular in Singapore. While it acknowledged the benefits of drinking green tea and
            black tea in
            reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis and cancer, respectively, the hospital cautions
            that the
            addition of other ingredients like non-dairy creamer and toppings in the tea could raise the fat and sugar
            content of
            the tea and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Non-dairy creamer is a milk substitute that contains
            trans fat in the
            form of hydrogenated palm oil. The hospital warned that this oil has been strongly correlated with an
            increased risk of
            heart disease and stroke.[56][57]

            The other concern about bubble tea is its high calorie content, partially attributed to the
            high-carbohydrate tapioca
            pearls (or 珍珠), which can make up to half the calorie-count in a 500ml serving of bubble tea.[58]
