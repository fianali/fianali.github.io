                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>My name is Fiana (she/her), and I'm a student at the Univesity of Colorado Boulder pursuing a BS in
                    Creative Technology and Design. I am currently in my junior year and am taking a lot of design
                    couses such as graphic design, web design, 3D modeling, and game development. My goals for my
                    academic career is to dip my toes into each design category and find a topic I enjoy. As of now,
                    sound design or UI/UX gives me interest!

                    In this website, you can get a glimpse of some previous/current projects that I've done and somes
                    extra projects that I do outside of school!
