            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My name is <a href="img/headshot.JPG">Fiana</a> (she/hers), and some of my goals of this course is to learn how to make a website, and use what
                I learn here to eventually make a nicer full force portfolio.

                I play the cello and piano and also spend a lot of my free time playing video games. I'm in the campus orchestra and will
                join intramural League of Legends. When not doing those activities, I work at the Kung Fu Tea on the Hill and make some
                yummy boba for customers! I love spending time with friends, even by doing the most mundane things.
