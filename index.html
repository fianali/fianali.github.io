                I play the cello and piano and also spend a lot of my free time playing video games. I'm in the campus orchestra and will
                join intramural League of Legends. When not doing those activities, I work at the Kung Fu Tea on the Hill and make some
                yummy boba for customers! I love spending time with friends, even by doing the most mundane things.
