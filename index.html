    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href="img/headshot.JPG">Fiana <img src="img/headshot.JPG" width="133.46" height="100">
        </a> (she/hers), and some of my goals of this course is to learn how to make a website, and use what I learn
        here to eventually make a nicer full force portfolio.

        I play the cello and piano and also spend a lot of my free time playing video games. I'm in the campus orchestra
        and will
        join intramural League of Legends. When not doing those activities, I work at the Kung Fu Tea on the Hill and
        make some
        yummy boba for customers! I love spending time with friends, even by doing the most mundane things.
