Hello, this will be for my personal site.

My name is img/headshot.JPG (she/hers), and some of my goals of this course is to learn how to make a website, and use what I learn here to eventually make a nicer full force portfolio.

I play the cello and piano and also spend a lot of my free time playing video games. I'm in the campus orchestra and will
join intramural League of Legends. When not doing those activities, I work at the Kung Fu Tea on the Hill and make some
yummy boba for customers! I love spending time with friends, even by doing the most mundane things.

This is my favorite https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4RiYBz6V2Q YouTube Video.
