            <h2> A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Fiana Li and I grew up in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. After finishing highschool, I pursued a
                degree in computer science at the Univerisity of Colorado Boulder, but soon realized it wasn't for me. I
                then switched to a Bachelor of science in Creative Technology in Design, and am furthermore enjoying the
                time I have at university. My goals are to get a job in sound design, specifically in the video game
                industry. However, UX/UI design is also interesting and I wouldn't mind following that course as well.

            <p>
                As a college student, I try to focus not only on my studies, but in social aspects as well. I've always
                loved classical music, and continue this hobby by playing cello in the university's campus orchestra.
                I also love to game and am part of the Women's League of Legends team and the CU Gaming media team.
                Recently, I've joined the intramural volleyball team, but I'm still working on my fundamentals :)
